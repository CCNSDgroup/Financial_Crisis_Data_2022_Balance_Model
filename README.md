# Financial_crisis_data_2022_model_balance
This is the repository for Data and results used in the paper (Financial Crisis in the Framework of Non-zero Temperature Balance Theory). The Data have been downloaded from www.yahoofinance.com. 

The first folder provides the time series of all 40 companies that have been selected randomly from distinct industries, in the time periods of 2005 to 2022, in the .csv format. These are the raw data that have been used in this study and downloaded from www.yahoofinance.com.  

The two crises that we have focused on are the Great Recession 2008, and the COVID-19 Recession 2020. For each crisis, we consider two periods that are close and far from a crisis to investigate the behavior of a financial market in on and off crisis periods. The second folder contains the four correlation matrices corresponding to two off-crisis and two on-crisis periods.
